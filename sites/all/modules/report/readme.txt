Report module collects historical data every day through a cron job and displays them as a table. If chart module (http://drupal.org/project/chart) is installed, it also displays a chart when appropriate.

Two permissions are available; "access report" and "administer report".

After enabling the site, go to "http://www.example.com/report" to see the report (Replace the example domain with your own). The links is also added to the navigation block.

You can go to "http://www.example.com/report/settings" to set the time when daily historical data is recorded and other cofigurations for user and content.
