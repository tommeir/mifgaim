The Basics
==========
Show aliases module (showaliases) enables privileged users to see all url aliases (paths) assigned to a node, from within the node edit page.

No configuration necessary (or available), except for granting selected roles the 'see aliases' capability at http://example.com/admin/user/permissions (where example.com is the URL of your web site).

Installation
============
Installing Show aliases (showaliases) is straightforward.  Copy the showaliases directory into your web site's /sites/all/modules directory.  Then, activate the module by visiting http://example.com/admin/modules (where example.com is the URL of your web site).

(For even easier installation of this and other Drupal modules, use Drush: http://drupal.org/project/drush )

Requirements
============
Show aliases requires Drupal 6 or later, though there's no reason it couldn't be backported.
