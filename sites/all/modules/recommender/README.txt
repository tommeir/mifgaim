Recommender API -- README

The goal of the project is to provide easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, 
fully-documented APIs for developers to write cool Drupal modules based on 
recommender algorithms.

The module provides several core algorithms in the API framework. But in order 
to use those algorithms in Drupal, you need to write your own modules using the
APIs, or use existing modules such as the User-to-user Recommendation module.

Module developers: Please refer to README.html, or visit the project homepage
