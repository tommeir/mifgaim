Author Select transforms the autocomplete Author field on node add/edit forms to a select widget. That way, the user doesn't have to guess the first couple letters of the desired username. Instead, he/she can just browse the select box and find it.

Note that this module isn't really useful for sites with many users because the select box will be so big.
