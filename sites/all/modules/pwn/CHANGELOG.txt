02/24/10
--------
- Added ability for a user to share permissions through granting roles to users
  if those roles do not have a permission the user does not have themselves

07/20/09
--------
- Users with 'share permissions' permission can access the permissions
  administration page like a user with 'administer permissions', but they can
  only see permissions that exist in one of their roles (using menu_alter and
  form_alter).  No configuration options.
