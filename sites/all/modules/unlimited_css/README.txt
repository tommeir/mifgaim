This module solves the Internet Explorer limitation of loading not more then 
30 CSS files per HTML page  (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262161). 
It is suitable for Drupal websites using lots of modules that can quickly 
increase the number of CSS files. The module doesn't require any configuration, 
just enable it and it will change the way Drupal loads CSS files automatically. 
It works well with built-in Drupal 6 CSS compression.
