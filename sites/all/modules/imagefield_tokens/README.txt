Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q. Aren't tokens already supported in the ImageField module?

A. Only User tokens are supported in the ImageField module.

   Node tokens allow you to use the Node ID, Node Title, Node creation date and
   much more in your ALT/Title text where User tokens are very limited.


Q. Is there going to be a Drupal 5 version?

A. Yes, I have already completed a Development build for Drupal 5, however it is
   dependent on a patch for ImageField 5.x-2.x-dev.

   The sooner it is reviewed/tested and committed the sooner the Drupal 5
   version of ImageField Tokens will be released, so if you have the know how,
   head over to the issue: http://drupal.org/node/406874
