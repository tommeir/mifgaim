-- SUMMARY --

Now you can display vocabularies as radios or checkboxes.

Configuration is very simple, edit the vocabulary and enable the Taxonomy Super Select option.

This module seamlessly overrides the select box generated by the taxonomy module and renders the terms based on if you are allowing multiple selections or not.
Features

    * Multiple selection vocabularies show as checkboxes.
    * Single selection terms display as radio boxes.
    * Parent terms display as nested fieldsets
    * Option to display parented terms as form items
    * Ability to control which content types TSS will apply to
    * Currently hardcoded to display up to five levels of nesting
    * Works with all hierarchy configurations

Free tagging vocabularies are now supported.
