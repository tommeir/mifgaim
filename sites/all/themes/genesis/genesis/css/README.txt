  This README covers the core CSS files, please read carefully.


  /css/
  
  NOTE: base.css, layout.css and edit-links.css are all compressed versions. See the
        equivalent file in /css/uncompressed for the fully commented versions.
  
    base.css
      Base is the master reset for browsers and Drupal. Base contains an exact
      copy of the modular stylsheets in /genesis/css/modular:

      - typography.css
      - tables.css
      - messages.css
      - lists.css
      - forms.css
      - admin-styles.css

      By default Genesis uses base.css, mainly because Drupal can 
      load a ridiculus number of stylesheets depending on what modules
      you have enabled; base.css is an effort to reduce http requests and 
      mitigate triggering IE's max 30 linked stylesheets issue.

      To gain more control over the stylesheets you can unset this and load
      a subset of the modular stylesheets - see genesis.info.
    
      NOTE: You shoud NEVER modify base.css OR any of the modular stylesheets.
            The correct method is to override the styles in your subthemes
            style.css file.
  
  
    edit-links.css
      Style edit links for blocks and views.
 
    
    layout.css
      Genesis layout methods. See /css/uncompressed/layout.css for full 
      instructions and comments.



  /css/dev/
  
    grid.css
      Enable this if you want to show the vertical grid for text flow.
      You will need to add the "grid" CSS class to the #container div
      in page.tpl.php.

    
    
  /css/ie/
  
    ie-example.css
      Support for the Conditional Styles module. 
 
      This module allows themes to specify conditional stylesheets in their .info file 
      and the conditional comments will be automatically included at the end of the 
      standard $styles variable. 
 
      http://drupal.org/project/conditional_styles
 
      Install the module and then uncomment or add the required stylesheets in yourÂ¨
      subthemes .info file.
 
      Core IE stylesheet. Add declarations here for ALL subthemes. To add IE styles
      to only one subtheme, see your subthemes css/ie/ie.example.css file for instructions.
